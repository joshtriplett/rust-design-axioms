*What is some aspect of Rust's design that you feel is not explained by the existing axioms? Or perhaps you think the existing axioms could be changed or combined?*

*If you are proposing a new axiom, start with a **hypothesis:** something you believe to be true about Rust's users and especially what they value. Then propose the conclusion: the thing Rust does as a result of that.*
